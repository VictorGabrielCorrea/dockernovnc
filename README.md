# docker-novnc

Simple noVNC container with openbox window manager for building new images on. Used on several other projects of mine

Exposes port 6080 for the noVNC session (for now) - may change in the future

Change the app-startup.sh file for your individual needs (you can just append to the file in a new Dockerfile)
