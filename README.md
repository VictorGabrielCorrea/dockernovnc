# docker-novnc

Simple noVNC container with openbox window manager for building new images on. Used on several other projects of mine

Exposes port 80 for the noVNC session (port 6080 in the dokcer-compose file)

Change the app-startup.sh file for your individual needs (you can just append to the file in a new Dockerfile)
